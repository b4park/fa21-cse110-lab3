# Standup Notes
  
**What did I work on yesterday?**

In this section, we will be discussing what progress or discussions were held in the previous meeting. This particular section is very important
because we can talk about:
```
What we accomplished?
What were our goals?
What was not accomplished?
What should we do next?
```
You should consider all these questions and more when discussing about the previous meeting.

**What am I working on today?**

Now this is the most important question mainly because we must not discuss what we are doing in the current day. This is where we must decide to set goals
and address specific issues that came up in earlier meetings or when working independently. It is during this time when we must worry about what work
must be done and what has been done already.

**What issues are blocking me?**

This is where we discuss the aspects of our life that prevents us from accomplishing our goals. Whether they be distractions or entertainment. 
There is always a place and time for these things and knowing how to balance work and fun is an essential part of working.
And its always nice to keep a list of priorities like:
1. Family
2. Work
3. Friends
4. Etc...

So this way you always know what is important and what needs to be your priority.
